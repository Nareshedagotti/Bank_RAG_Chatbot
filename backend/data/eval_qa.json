For\nStudent or Salary accounts, the requirement is $0.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t maintain the balance for just one day?\nBecause we use the Average Monthly Balance method, falling below the limit for a single\nday does not automatically trigger a penalty. As long as your average across the whole month\nstays above the requirement, no fee is charged.\nHow are the penalties calculated?\nPenalties are calculated at the end of the calendar month. The system looks at the\npercentage of the shortfall. For example, if you are supposed to keep $500 but only kept\n$400, your shortfall is 20%, placing you in the lowest penalty bracket.\nCan I avoid fees by closing the account?\nYes, if you choose to close your account, no further maintenance fees will apply once the\nclosure process is finalized.
